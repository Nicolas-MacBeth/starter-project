# starter-project

Starter project in Go to increase familiarity with GCP and OpenTelemetry. It is composed of three services: *FoodFinder*, *FoodSupplier*, *FoodVendor*. They will interact together as a suite of products to give a user the availability of a certain ingredient. Each service has its own server and some services will also need their own mySQL DB table(s).

1. Clone repo
2. Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
3. Run `cd starter-project && go run main.go`
